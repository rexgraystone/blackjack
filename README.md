## Rules

Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards. The player can then choose to hit (get another card) or stand (stop getting cards). If the player goes over 21, they lose. If the player gets 21, they win. If the player stands, the dealer will then hit or stand. If the dealer goes over 21, the player wins. If the dealer gets 21, the dealer wins. If neither the player nor the dealer gets 21, whoever is closest to 21 wins.
